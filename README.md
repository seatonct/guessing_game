This guessing game is a guide project from chapter 2 of the online book, The Rust Programming Language.
It is a number guessing game that generates a random number between 0 and 100, and gives the user infinite oppurtunities to guess the number.
Non-numerical input is ignored.
When the user guesses the correct number, the program exits.
The user may exit the program before guessing the correct number with the key combination `ctrl` + `c`.

To test:
1. Clone this repository.
2. In your terminal, run `cargo run` in the root directory.
